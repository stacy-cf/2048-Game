# 2048-Game

Followed a tutorial on YouTube to learn more about object oriented programming in Python and gain exposure to Tkinter. 

Recreated the game 2048, where the user starts with two tiles numbered either 2 or 4 and must use the arrow keys to move and multiply the tiles (only tiles with matching numbers can be multiplied) in order to achieve the number 2048 before running out of moves. Used Tkinter to implement the GUI.
